\section{\label{sec:level1}Introduction} 
The design developed by Paik et al. whereby a transmon qubit is coupled to a 3D cavity waveguide provided an increased qubit coherence time and presented the hybrid superconducting circuit as a promising scalable architecture for quantum computing $^{[}$\citep{Paik2011ObservationArchitecture}$^{]}$. Transmon qubits have a circuit design similar to the charge qubit but with an increased insensitivity to charge noise due to the addition of a large capacitance in parallel to the Cooper-pair box $^{[}$\citep{Koch2007Charge-insensitiveBox}$^{]}$. The quantum processor unit (QPU) recently produced by Rigetti consists of 19 Al transmon qubits which are individually coupled to a 1D transmission line superconducting resonator and manipulated by input RF pulses $^{[}$\citep{Otterbach2017UnsupervisedComputer,Blais2004CavityComputation}$^{]}$. Rigetti's Forest environment and instructional language PyQuil enables interfacing with the quantum processor to enable cloud based quantum computing $^{[}$\citep{Smith2016AArchitecture}$^{]}$. 

The aim of the report is to utilise Rigetti's cloud platform to complete gate operations on the hybrid system and analyse the fidelity of implementing single and two-qubit gates. To perform gate fidelity measurements two techniques, QPT and randomised benchmarking, are investigated. In addition, we took part in Rigetti's first hackathon event and developed a random quantum circuit generator game. This report also considers each of the analysis techniques for estimating the error threshold required for the user to play this game on the QPU. Although it may appear frivolous to create a quantum game, the gaming industry is often the driving force for innovation of new technologies. The creation of games and simulations can also provide valuable educational tools, making understanding of quantum computing more accessible to those outwith the field of research $^{[}$\citep{Bekebrede2011ReviewingGeneration}$^{]}$. Additionally, game theory and quantum games provide interesting insights which aid in development of quantum algorithms $^{[}$\citep{Flitney2002AnTheory}$^{]}$.
