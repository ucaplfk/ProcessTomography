\begin{abstract}The 19Q processor and interfacing software developed by Rigetti was used to probe the fidelity of the applied gates. Properties about the imperfect quantum gates were investigated using quantum process tomography (QPT) to extract the representation in the Pauli transfer matrix and estimate the average gate fidelity. Completing QPT of the CZ gate to entangle qubits 8 and 13, which are connected via a superconducting resonator, resulted in an average gate fidelity of 0.908. This value is comparable to the result of 0.899 determined similarly by Rigetti. Additionally, the average gate error of qubit 8 was determined by randomised benchmarking to be $12.9 \times 10^{-3}$ where Rigetti additionally obtained $13.1 \times 10^{-3}$ using the same analysis technique. Initial steps were taken to explore the optimal method to determine an appropriate error threshold for the quantum random circuit game. The inclusion of SWAP gates are of particular interest due to their significant gate error rate. \end{abstract}
